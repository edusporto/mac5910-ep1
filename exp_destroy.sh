# =================================================================
# A very simple bash script to load-test an MQTT broker.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Save this file as simple_load_test.sh
# 2. Make it executable: chmod +x simple_load_test.sh
# 3. Run it, passing the broker's IP address as an argument:
#    ./simple_load_test.sh <BROKER_IP_ADDRESS>
#
# If no IP is given, it defaults to localhost.
# =================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
BROKER_HOST=${1:-"localhost"} # Use the first argument or default to localhost
NUM_CLIENTS=50
PUBLISHER_LOOPS=50
TOPIC="simple.bash.test"
MESSAGE="hello from bash script"

# --- Cleanup Function ---
# This function will be called automatically when the script exits
# (either normally or via Ctrl+C) to kill all background subscribers.
